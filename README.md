# Tone Matching App

A participatory phonology analysis tool for native speakers to compare and group words by tone melodies.

## Overview

This system helps linguists and native speakers conduct participatory phonology analysis by:
- **Simplifying the process** of grouping words with similar tone melodies
- **Using visual aids** (pictures) instead of technical terminology
- **Supporting multiple speakers** for validation and consensus building
- **Preserving data integrity** of existing phonology databases

Perfect for field linguists working on tone languages, orthography development, and phonological analysis.

## Project Structure

This repository contains three main components:

### 1. Mobile App (`mobile_app/`)
**Flutter application for Android and Windows Desktop**

Native speakers use this app to:
- Load phonological data bundles
- Listen to words and compare tone melodies
- Draw pictures representing each tone pattern
- Group words with similar tones
- Export results with tone group assignments

**Key Features:**
- Graphical, icon-based UI (minimal text)
- Camera integration for exemplar drawings
- Audio playback with replay capability
- Offline operation (no internet required)
- Preserves original XML encoding

### 2. Bundler App (`bundler_app/`)
**Electron desktop application for researchers**

Researchers use this app to:
- Configure phonological data bundles
- Select Dekereke XML files and audio files
- Define display settings and data mappings
- Filter by grammatical category and syllable pattern
- Generate bundle zip files for the mobile app

**Key Features:**
- Parse and validate XML files
- Audio file filtering and validation
- Reference number filtering
- Customizable field mappings
- Missing file reporting

### 3. Comparison App (`comparison_app/`)
**Electron desktop application for researchers**

Researchers use this app to:
- Import results from multiple native speakers
- Compare tone groupings across speakers
- Identify words with disagreements
- Find merged groups (same tone, different exemplars)
- Calculate agreement statistics

**Key Features:**
- Multi-speaker result comparison
- Disagreement detection
- Overlap analysis (>80% threshold)
- Visual results presentation
- Statistical summaries

## Requirements

### Mobile App
- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher
- Dart 3.0 or higher
- Android device/emulator or Windows PC

### Desktop Apps
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm (included with Node.js)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Quick Start

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rulingAnts/tone_matching_app.git
cd tone_matching_app
```

**2. Set up Mobile App:**
```bash
cd mobile_app
flutter pub get
flutter run  # For Android/Windows
```

**3. Set up Bundler App:**
```bash
cd bundler_app
npm install
npm start
```

**4. Set up Comparison App:**
```bash
cd comparison_app
npm install
npm start
```

### Basic Workflow

**Step 1: Prepare Data (Researcher)**
1. Export data from Dekereke/phonology database as XML
2. Gather corresponding WAV audio files
3. Use Bundler App to create a bundle
4. Transfer bundle to mobile device

**Step 2: Analyze Tone (Native Speaker)**
1. Load bundle in Mobile App
2. Listen to first word, draw a picture of the tone pattern
3. For each subsequent word:
   - Listen to the word
   - Compare with existing tone groups
   - Add to matching group or create new group
4. Export results when complete

**Step 3: Review Results (Researcher)**
1. Import exported results
2. Use Comparison App if multiple speakers analyzed the same data
3. Review tone group assignments
4. Update phonology database

## Key Features

### For Native Speakers
- **Simple interface**: Icons and pictures, not technical terms
- **Natural workflow**: Compare sounds like you would naturally
- **Visual memory aids**: Draw your own pictures for each tone pattern
- **Flexible**: Add to existing groups or create new ones anytime
- **Portable**: Works offline on Android phones or Windows computers

### For Researchers
- **Data preservation**: Original XML structure and encoding maintained
- **Flexible filtering**: Work with specific grammatical categories or syllable patterns
- **Multi-speaker support**: Compare results from different speakers
- **Quality assurance**: Identify disagreements and validate groupings
- **Standards compatible**: Works with Dekereke XML format

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile App**: Flutter/Dart
- **Desktop Apps**: Electron/Node.js
- **Data Format**: XML (UTF-16), CSV
- **Audio Format**: WAV (16-bit or 24-bit)

## Use Cases

1. **Tone language phonology**: Identify surface tone melodies
2. **Orthography development**: Determine which tones need marking
3. **Dictionary work**: Classify words by tonal patterns
4. **Language documentation**: Record native speaker classifications
5. **Multi-dialect comparison**: Compare tone systems across dialects
